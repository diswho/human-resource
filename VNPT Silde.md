**Summary:**  
In his article, General Secretary Tô Lâm emphasizes that **digital transformation** transcends the mere application of digital technology in socio-economic activities. It fundamentally establishes an advanced **"digital production method"**, characterized by:  
1. A harmonious synergy between human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI);  
2. The elevation of **data** as a critical resource and production asset;  
3. Profound shifts in production relations, particularly in ownership and distribution models of digital means of production.  

He argues that this transformation is a pivotal driver for modernizing productive forces and reshaping production relations, propelling the nation into a new era of development. The process redefines traditional economic structures, prioritizing adaptability, innovation, and the strategic integration of digital tools to foster sustainable growth.
